    eviction-interval-timer-in-ms: 60000 # default is 60000

    # Switch off self-preservation. Will turn lease expiration on and evict all instances which no longer sent a heartbeat and whose lease has expired.
    # Self-preservation is desirable for Eureka clusters and where network outages (e.g. between data centers) could be possible.
    # Note: the lease validity / expiration is configured in the Eureka _client_ instances (see eureka.instance.lease-expiration-duration-in-seconds).
    enable-self-preservation: false # default is true

    # Make sure this is set to the same value as the lease renewal interval in Eureka _client_ instances (or slightly higher)
    # This value is relevant for Eureka's calculation of the 'current renewal threshold'.
    # Specifically, the following equation is used: current renewal threshold = (60s / expected-client-renewal-interval-seconds) * renewal-percent-threshold * current number of client instances.
    # In this case:
    # - for one registered client: 60 / 3 * 0.5 * 1 = 10.
    # - for two registered clients: 60 / 3 * 0,5 * 2 = 20.
    # As soon as two clients are connected:
    expected-client-renewal-interval-seconds:  3
